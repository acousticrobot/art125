Dear Students,

We have hit the end of our coursework.  Thank you all for your continued efforts and insightful comments in the discussion forums.

At this point I have graded all submitted papers and assignments. Please use this week to submit any missing papers or discussion forum posts, or taking any missing Assessments.

The final exam will open on Wednesday and will be available through next Tuesday December 18th. Please note I will not be able to grant extensions after this point because I must get final grades in for all students. Don't wait until the last minute to take the exam!

All exam questions will be taken from the assessment questions you have already seen, so be sure to use the unit assessments to study for the exam. Remember that you can take these quizzes as many times as you want.

The final exam is worth 15% of your final grade.  If you take a look at your current grade, you should be able to predict what you final grade will be once you have completed this exam, by adding up to 15 points to your current grade.

Best,
Jonathan
