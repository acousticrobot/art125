Dear Students,

We have hit the end of our coursework.  Thank you all for your continued efforts and insightful comments in the discussion forums.

We have one last discussion forum for Unit 13 which I will be grading promptly next Monday. At this point I have graded all other submitted papers and assignments. Please use this week to submit any missing papers or discussion forum posts, and make sure you have taken all of the Quizzes at least once.

The final exam will open tomorrow and will be available through next Sunday December 15th. Please note I will not be able to grant extensions after this point because I must get final grades in for all students. Don't wait until the last minute to take the exam!

All exam questions will be taken from the assessment questions you have already seen, so be sure to use the unit assessments to study for the exam. Remember that you can take these quizzes as many times as you want.

Best,
Jonathan
