Hello Students of Art 125,

This week is dedicated towards studying for and taking the midterm exam.

The midterm will be visible starting tomorrow, right under Unit 6, and will be available through Sunday.

The midterm contains content from units 1 through 6 inclusive.  The questions on the midterm will be taken from both the chapter review questions (from the textbook) and the unit review questions ( the slide identification, definitions, etc. ) You should be finished with all of the unit quizzes before taking the midterm because they are there to help you study for the midterm.

The Midterm will be broken (approximately) into these categories:

Image Identification: 25 questions
Definitions: 10 questions
Movements and their Artists: 5 questions
History and Biography: 20 questions
Philosophy: 5 questions

Remember that unit review and chapter review quizzes can be taken as many times as you want, they are there for practice. They also have no time limit.

The midterm you can only take once, and has a time limit of 2 hours ( much more that I think it will take, you should be done in 45 minutes). The important thing to remember is to take this test all at once. If you leave to return to it later, chances are your time will have expired.

Please also take this week to turn in any missing work -- I will still give partial credit for late assignments.

Best,
Jonathan
