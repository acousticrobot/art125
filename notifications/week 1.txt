## Welcome to Topics in Contemporary Art!

I have been teaching this class for the last five years, but this is the first time we are using the Blackboard learning system. Please let me know if anything is unclear, hard to find, or not working properly for you, so I can address it for you and the rest of your classmates.

Please take a moment to gain familiarity with the learning environment. Here are three places to start:

## Lessons

Take a look at **Unit 1** in the **Lessons** section. This will be the unit for this week. There is a discussion forum inside of it that you must post to by Thursday night, and then you must respond to two of your classmate's posts by Sunday night. These two due dates (Thursday and Sunday) will be reoccurring almost every week of the semester.

## Discussion Forums

You can also find all of the semester's discussion forums in the **Discussions** section. Go find the forum titled "Welcome to the Discussion Forums" inside there now.  Go ahead, click into it and introduce yourself to the class. This way you can gain familiarity with each other, and with the system before your first "real" forum post on Thursday.

## Course Info

Finally, take a look under the **Course Info.** section. I will continue to post all important information about the class in this section.

### Here are a few additional items to be aware of:

#### ASSESSMENTS:

Each unit usually has one or two assessments (quizzes) that you should do on your own time. The assessments are available for you to take as many times as you want, so keep doing them until you are satisfied with your knowledge of the material and with your grade. They are not due at any specific time, but be aware that UNFINISHED ASSESSMENTS TURN INTO A ZERO GRADE when I do the final grading at the end, it is your responsibility to make sure you have completed them all.

#### EXAMS:

There will be a Midterm and Final Exam, and you will be given time to study for each.  All of the questions are multiple choice, taken from the assessments questions from the units.  Do well on those and you will be set for the midterm and final.

#### FIELD TRIP

You will be required to make it out to see galleries or a museum during the semester. I'm telling you about it now so you can plan in advance. Reporting back about your experience is due in Unit 9 -- you can find more information about this assignment there.

#### RESEARCH PAPER  

The information on the research paper is also visible to you already, so you can start thinking about it, but you won't have to choose an artist or do anything until after the midterm. More information to follow.

That's it for now -- see you in the discussion forums!
