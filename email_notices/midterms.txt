Hello Students of Art 125,

I have just finished grading your last week discussion forum.  If anyone has outstanding work that is missing a grade, please let me know.  Each week I try to give you some feedback on your forum posts, but I'm not sure where these comments show up on your side of things.  If you haven't been seeing comments with your grades, let me know and I'll look into it.

This is our last week before the midterms. This week we cover unit 6, as you probably know by now, your initial post is due on Saturday, and two responses due on Sunday. Next week is reserved for studying. The midterm will be open from Thursday, March 8th, through Sunday March 10th.

The Midterm will be broken (approximately) into these categories:

Image Identification: 25 questions
Definitions: 10 questions
Movements and their Artists: 5 questions
History and Biography: 20 questions
Philosophy: 5 questions

The midterm contains content from units 1 through 6 inclusive.  Both the chapter review questions (from the textbook) and the unit review questions ( the slide identification, definitions, etc. ) are going to be counted towards your grades, and are fair game for the midterm. You should be finished with all of the unit quizzes before taking the midterm because they are there to help you study for the midterm.

Unit review and chapter review quizzes can be taken as many times as you want, they are there for practice. They also have no time limit.

The midterm you can only take once, and has a time limit of 2 hours ( much more that I think it will take, you should be done in 45 minutes).  If you have accommodations please email me a copy and you will receive the test with a 4 hour limit.

Best,
Jonathan
