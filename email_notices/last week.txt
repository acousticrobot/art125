Dear Students,

We have hit the end of our accelerated course.  Thank you all for your continued efforts and insightful comments in the discussion forums.  I will be grading your papers this week, and preparing a final exam for you as you finish up the last two units.  Please note, as our class ends on Thursday, I have eliminated the usual response requirements from this weeks discussion forums.

The final exam will be available for you to take from Friday through Sunday.  Please don't wait until the last minute in case you have any technical troubles, as there will be no time on Monday to take the test before final grades are due. All the questions will be taken from the assessments questions you have already seen, so be sure to use the unit assessments to study for the exam.

It has come to my attention that the links to the images for unit 11 are broken. I have notified the technical team and they should have this sorted out tomorrow.

Best,
Jonathan
