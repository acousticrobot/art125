## 50s sculpture

Just as Greenberg said art should be reduced to its most pure form, paintings being paintings, sculptures being sculptures, artists in the 50s tended to focus on one medium only. Sculptors such as David Smith often worked strictly in three dimensions rather than planning out pieces with drawings, even though he shared the tough guy attitude of his fellow abstract expressionists. 

David Smith's compositions were often made with found scraps of metal which he composed much as a painter worked with brushstrokes, adding a piece here, removing one there. Often there is an associative quality to these pieces as they look like figures or animals.

The composition of these pieces can be talked about similarly to the composition of a painting, where certain forms balance out other forms. Additionally with sculpture there is the physical balance of weight as the weight of one piece balances against the weight of another one.

Towards the end of his life Smith often worked with stainless steel to prevent his sculptures from rusting in outdoor environments. He had the ability to weld stainless steel but not to cut it so these forms were created with shapes he ordered pre-fabricated. This accounts in part for the much more geometric shapes in these later works. 

Despite the almost absolute abstraction in these pieces they still sometimes seem to reference the human figure.

The surface treatment of these pieces is created with a hand grinder. In the reflected sunlight in this photo you can see the expressive gestural marks this creates, much like the expressive brushstrokes of his fellow painters.

Louise Nevelson emigrated from Russia in her childhood and grew up to be an vibrant and flamboyant New York artist who could hold her own in the macho art world of the 1950s.

Noticing the abundance of scrap wood and discarded furniture that she was able to find on the streets of New York, she started collected the material and assembling it into sculptures.

Most of her pieces were presented against a wall, presenting a definite front side, similarly to reliefs in more traditional sculpture. Her found wooden objects were often arranged in stacked crates or boxes, lending an overall geometric structure to the work.

The pieces were painted one color, usually black, to bring unity to the different shapes and to emphasize form over color.

Several of the pieces have titles like Cathedral or Nightscape, referencing their resemblance to the heavily decorated architectural facade of a cathedral, or a city skyline at night .

## Minimalism I

Donald Judd said in 1965 "Half or more of the best new work in the last few years has been neither painting nor sculpture. Usually it has been related, closely or distantly, to one or the other."

Both an artists and an art critic, Judd set the stage for much of the way artwork in the 60s was viewed.  Even though he, like many artists grouped under the term, distrusted the term 'Minimalism', he is often seen as the leading artist promoting the ideas behind the movement.

The 60s and 70s brought about a huge technological advances in the production of factory produced materials, coatings and colors.  Instead of focusing on the artist's personal hand, Judd saw this as an opportunity to make artworks that were planned with blueprints, and then manufactured in factories.

Judd's work often makes use of repetition, but unlike the work coming out of Warhol's factory, Judd made clean, machine like units without imperfections.

Judd saw sculpture as being "made part by part, by addition, composed" just as we talked about the work of David Smith.  In contrast, the new work, through repetition and order denies composition and instead finds order through regularity.

Dan Flavin, a friend of Donald Judd, took much of Judd's philosophy to heart in his own work. 

Instead of having units manufactured according to his designs, he worked with standard florescent lighting fixtures arranging them into ordered compositions.

The use of light allowed him to create pieces whose presence filled much more than just the physical space it occupied.

By arranging colored lights, he was able to take color, usually a medium reserved for painters, and bring it into the realm of sculpture.  Notice how the red and yellow bars here stand out against the blue and green ones reflecting off the wall behind.  Think about how this works similarly to the push-pull of Hans Hofmann, and how it changes these principals by bringing color into three dimensions.

## Minimalism II

Frank Stella was also grouped with the Minimalists, but the longer they knew each other, the more Stella and Judd disagreed about what made good minimalist artwork.

Stella worked with ordinary house painting brushes and paint, but he was still working by hand along with all the blurry edges and brush strokes that that comes with.  Notice through repetition how he has created a sense of depth in this piece. All the lines in this piece are either horizontal or vertical, but out eyes fill in four diagonal lines which seem to recede in space towards the corners.

Stella's paintings were stretched on thick 3" stretchers, and Judd wanted to look at them as slabs hanging on the wall. Again his idea of new works that were neither painting or sculpture.  But Stella saw his works strictly as paintings, and believed he was very much continuing the history of painting rather than breaking with it.

When he adds color into his compositions, a new level of reading is introduced.  Just like with Hofmann we have the competing readings based on form, which tells us we are looking down into a tunnel, and color, which bounces around based on warms and cools.

The later work of Stella becomes more and more complex, until it can hardly be called minimal at all.  The organization of color and form here tells our minds many conflicting stories here, which take careful observation in order to work out.

Besides Minimalism, Sol leWitt is also seen as part of the Conceptual Art movement.

He believed the most important part of an artwork was the idea itself, and tried to create artworks that emphasized thought over material.

Many of his works involved the idea of permutations, that is, different combinations of a set of conditions.  For instance, here is the frontispiece for a set of etchings.  Each one represents one combination of a horizontal, vertical or left or right diagonal line.  Between the fifteen pieces all possible combinations are represented.

The pieces he is most well know for might be his wall drawings.  In these pieces a set of instructions are given to the production team, who interpret the instructions and create the pieces on the wall without the artist present.

Some of the later work includes colors as well, instructing the installation crew to use colored ink washes applied directly to the wall. Notice how the directions in this piece are based on the same line directions he use in the set of etchings we just saw.

## The Monumental

Now, I'm titling this section "Monumental" but I don't want you to think this is a movement or anything. I'm mostly interested in exploring how monumental scale, really big artworks, came about in the 60's and 70's. Scale isn't entirely new, we talked about big scale with the Abstract Expressionists, and certainly big artworks existed in the past, sometimes assembled by large teams of artists like Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, or even Stonehenge. Here we have a painting by the German Romanticist Caspar David Friedrich.  I want to show this to you because the painting isn't even all that big, but by painting the tiny figure of the monk staring out at the vast sea, he creates in our mind an understanding of scale, of the immenseness of nature that could swallow us whole. This feeling of being a tiny speck in the vast universe, both the terror and awe of this feeling, is referred to as the sublime.

The work of Robert Morris doesn't fit neatly into just one category.  He is often though of as a minimalist, but his ideas and Donald Judd's were diametrically apposed.  

Now looking at this piece that looks like a rough wooden crate, you probably understand if I call it minimalist.  Its a very simple box like a lot of what we see from the minimalists.  And you can see that it's very different than a Judd, in that it's rough instead of smooth, it looks old and well worn rather than new and shiny.  But would you believe me if I said you could think of it as figurative abstraction?

Morris titled this piece "Box For Standing", and here's a picture of him in his studio doing just that, standing in his sculpture.  So the box references the human figure, his human figure to be exact, since it's made to fit his height and width.

In fact, a lot of Morris' pieces reference the human figure in some way, like this piece called wheels, which was made in a dimension that allowed Morris to wheel around, turning the sculpture into a performance piece.  Donald Judd didn't like this at all; it didn't fit what he thought the new three dimensional work should be, in fact he felt it wasn't even sculpture, it was a theatre prop. 

I bring Morris up with the idea of the monumental because he also made pieces he called "Scatter Pieces" that I think of as landscapes.  He would fill the gallery space with industrial materials from wall to wall, making more of an environment to be walked through, rather than a single piece that you could take in from one vantage point.

Notice the mirrors he used in this one, reflecting the softer materials back at themselves.  The mirrors almost act as gateways, allowing the space to be even bigger than the size of the room.

Richard Serra is another artists interested in monumental scale, as you can see from the enormous piece behind him.

He also had some roots in performance, as you can see from this photograph of his creating one of his pieces call "Throwing Lead".  I hope you can see the relationship to Jackson Pollock splashing paint on the horizontal canvas.  Serra takes from the macho gestures of the Abstract Expressionists and ups the ante, throwing liquid lead directly onto the walls and floor.

Sometimes, like Morris' box for standing, the performance is implied.  Serra made many prop pieces, which included a feeling of danger through potential energy.  Here a steel cube in propped into the corner of the room and held in place with a thick rod.  The piece looks like a human sized trap, just waiting to crush someone to death.

Like the earth artists we will study next, sometimes his work was installed outside, such as this steel plate wedged directly into the earth.  

Serra, continues to work with heavy steel sheets in gigantic proportions.  He builds small models of the pieces which are then reproduced by a team of construction workers. These pieces are so massive they must be assembled in shipyards.  

The pieces are so massive they tower over the viewers as they walk in and out of them.

The steel is left outside for a long time to develop a warm rusty patina.

## Earth Art

Last slideshow started off with a painting by Caspar David Friedrich and so does this one.  This time, we see a arctic shipwreck, the hull of a boat poking out of an iceberg, the mast shattered and scattered around.  When the German romanticists were painting in the 19th century nature was seen as a vast and wild thing, capable of destroying humankind without provocation.   By the 1960s a new awareness began to emerge that the opposite was true too.  Besides the sublime, there was also an awareness that the natural world was fragile and could become a victim of humanity as well.  

It would be convenient to say earth artists were environmentalists and nowadays this is often true.  For the first earth artists however, its a little more complicated than that, as they were often saw nature as a raw material to be studied, manipulated, or used, not just as something to be saved.

Robert Smithson was one such artists interested in land as a medium.

His early minimalist pieces were often inspired by natural processes such as the formation of crystals on a molecular level.

Or larger scale structures such as the stratification of the earths crust.

He too used mirrors to create the illusion of larger spaces, as well as to refer to distant locations, such as the beach where he gathered this crushed coral.

He was fascinated with the interaction of earth an human industry, often working on lands already disturbed or polluted.  Here is one of his pour pieces. In this one he poured a barrel of glue down a hill.  

His most famous piece, Spiral Jetty, rises out of the Great Salt lake on a remote Northern shore.  The shape reflects a salt crystal, which forms in a spiral, but the width of the jetty, large enough to support the dump truck which carried the gravel used to create the piece, reflects the much larger scale of the lake.

James Turrell is another artist you brought artwork out of the gallery and into the outdoors.  His primary obsession is the qualities of daylight.

His pieces often reflect his interest in Plato's cave, a philosophical metaphor introduced by the Greek philosopher in his dilogue "The Republic".  The metaphor is as follows: Imagine a row of prisoners who have spent their entire lives chained in a cave, and only allowed to look at the back wall.  Behind them, a series of events occurs, lit by a fire so that the shadows are cast upon the wall.  Since this is the only thing they know, they take these shadows to be reality.  
	Now, imagine one of these prisoners escapes and makes his way out into the sunlight. At first it is too bright, he doesn't know what he sees.  But gradually he begins to understand what the world is really like. In Plato's metaphor, this freed man represents the philosopher, who knows the world for what it really is.  If he returns to the cave, and tells his friends what he has seen, they believe he has gone mad, for how could what he tells them be true.  
	For Turrell, this experience, of coming into the light and seeing things new is the experience he wishes to create for his audience.

I am going to walk you through an indoor piece by Turell to give you a sense of how he achieves this.  Here we are in a dark corridor in a museum, at the end of the hallway to the right is a door filled with a mysterious blue light.  

As you enter the room, all that you can make out at first is an intense blue light, and the silhouette of anyone standing in front of you.  Gradually your eyes adjust.  The corners of the room are curved.  There are no lines to give you a sense of where you are.

In fact, if there is no one in front of you, is it hard to tell if the room has any depth at all.

As you turn around, the exit is clearly marked.  As you exit the room you become the philosopher, looking at life again as if for the first time.

When is comes to monumental artworks, this next one takes the cake.  James Turrell bought the extinct Roden Crater outside of Phoenex arizona in 1977.  He began constructing this work in 1979 and continues to work on it to this day.

The top of the crater acts as a natural dish, focusing the view away from the ground and up toward the sky.  Inside of the crater, he has been constructing a series of rooms and tunnels with skylights to observe the motions of the solar system.

Here is a model of one of the rooms to give you a sense of the immense vaulted ceilings.  

Here is one of the rooms, a bench rings the rounded wall to allow a view of the skylight above. Just as the Friedrich's Monk staring out into the sea reminds us of the sublime, here the viewer in Turrell's artwork can experience this feeling first hand.
