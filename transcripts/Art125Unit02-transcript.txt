## European Influence

Before the second world war the most popular style in America was called social realism. Realistic but somewhat stylized figurative works like what we see here by the artist Thomas Hart Benton. Jackson Pollock and many of the other Abstract Expressionists studied under Thomas Hart Benton or other social realists and they were very familiar with this style of art before they developed their own.

After world war II however, the younger artists felt that a new way of making art was needed in order to try and depict the new reality, and thus another artistic crisis was born. With the realization that the Nazi's were capable of killing 6 million innocent civilians in concentration camps...

Or that we now had a bomb that could kill 140,000 and weren't afraid to use it, these artists were confronted with a deep realization of humanities responsibility if we were to survive on this planet. This is exactly what Sartre was talking about when he says as humans we are condemned to be free and to bear the responsibility for that freedom.

Right before and during the second world war there were dozens and dozens of artists who came over from Europe and spend time in New York. Here's just a short list of some of the more famous artists who had a huge influence on American artists. I am going to concentrate on just two artists who came over from Europe and spent the remainder of their lives in the United States.

The first one is Arshile Gorky. Just as he changed his name, he was a very colorful figure who would make up elaborate stories about his past which he would tell at parties.  He also had a several periods in his life where he suffered a very deep depression. 

Here is a painting that Gorky spent years working on. It was based on the only photograph he had of his mother from when he was a child. Gorky came from the Armenian part of turkey that suffered a genocide during the first world war.  His mother died of starvation while they were fleeing Turkey, and he was left on his own to try to make it to America to find his father and older sister. You can see the influence of Picasso's work in this piece in the way that he's placed the figures in space, and much of Gorky's earlier work bears a resemblance to one or another artist who's work he was studying at that time. While the faces are very carefully and realistically rendered, the rest of the painting devolves into more organic abstract shapes.

When Gorky discovers his own style, it is definitely abstract, but his compositions are still based on realistic elements that have been abstracted to the point of no longer being recognizable. If we look at the left-hand side of this canvas we can almost make out something that looks like a figure with a red face and perhaps yellow hair, two black arms etc. And we see that the biomorphic shapes that were making up the bodies in the earlier portrait are very similar to the shapes that we see in this painting. 

One of his friends, another European artist named Matta, suggested that Gorky try using turpentine to thin down his paints and some of the later paintings are much more fluid and transparent like this one.  If we look in the background we still see those same biomorphic shapes. Now Matta was one of the surrealists and wanted to use this flowing paint as a way to sort of tap into the subconscious. 

Even though Matta and Gorky's paintings exhibit some similar shapes, their attitude towards painting remained  very different. Even in painting like this one Gorky always planned his paintings out before hand and knew where the shapes were going to be. For Gorky it was important that art remained a product of the thinking mind, he felt constant spontaneity was just chaos.

Hans Hofmann was a very different kind of painter thing Gorky although they were both extremely influential on the abstract expressionists.  Hofmann came over from Germany and started teaching in American art schools. Nearly half of all the abstract expressionists studied under Hans Hofmann at one time.  He spent most of his time teaching though and didn't have his first solo exhibition until late in life. We are going to concentrate on the term 'push pull' that Hans Hoffman used often to describe his painting technique. Before we go on I want you to look at this picture because I think his two arms demonstrate this idea very clearly, with the one pushing towards canvas any other one pulling away. Also we can see clearly here just how thick the paint on the canvas is, something that we won't necessarily be able to see as we look at the canvases in color straight on. 

His idea of 'push pull' comes from the basic tension set up in a picture when some shapes seem to come forward off the canvas, as others recede backwards into space. He used basic techniques that artists had been aware of for hundreds of years, such as warm or light colors appearing to come forward while dark and cool colors seem to go back.  But what makes these abstract painters different is that they believed just the relationships between color and shape alone were interesting enough to create a finished artwork. In this painting it is immediately clear that the red square and the yellow square feel as if their warm colors are floating off the canvas and above the cooler green and blue background. In the lower right corner however there is a tension that is generated by the yellow color that appears as if it is pushing up from behind the green, and trying to float in place with the similarly yellow colored square. Also on the left hand side we have an L-shaped gray area that sits slightly on top of a more warm ivory colored square. This ivory colored square wants to advanced towards us off the canvas and yet is pinned down by the gray square. It is the tension in our minds as we try to resolve the shapes and where they fit into space which generates interest in this canvas.

Here's another piece where we can also see this same idea of push and pull being demonstrated. The colors have been reversed from the last painting and the cool blues and greens are now in squares sitting on top of the warm orange and red background. This again creates an interesting tension.  If we just pay attention to the shapes on the canvas, all the colored rectangles seem to float in the same plane in front of the canvas. The blue square at the top interrupts this reading however, because it is pinned behind the swash of brown.  Now if tell our minds to pay attention to color, the dark blue squares can also look like deep holes punched into the surface, almost like windows looking out to a deep blue sky. The warm yellow still float towards us, and the grouping of a green, yellow and brown square, because they are touching, insist on staying in the same plane, despite the colors telling our minds that they shouldn't be.

## Line and Gesture

What we see here is the painting method Pollock became famous for. Instead of painting on an easel, he laid his massive canvasses down on the studio floor and dripped paint directly onto the surface. Let's take a little time and trace how he arrived at this method of working.

In this piece called "She Wolf", Pollock hasn't abandoned the figure yet, but much of his later style is already present. For one thing we have an "all over" composition, that is to say, the subject fills the entire canvas, to the point where it is almost all figure and no ground.  The wolf's  body stretches to fill every corner.  Also we see this expressive brushstroke that Pollock became known for.  One interesting thing to note in this piece is how the flat grey background has been painted on top of the rest of the painting.  Usually a background is used to create depth in the painting, but here is does the opposite, forcing everything onto the top layer of the canvas.

In this piece he has abandoned the figure entirely, and just concentrated on the expressive brushstroke.  Examining the this paint on the canvas, we see it has still been painted in a traditional manner, propped on and easel and painted with paint brushes.

Now we see his mature style, one of a series he made for his solo show in 1950.  The paint has been thinned to a liquid and dripped onto the canvas which was laying on the floor.  There is a direct relationship between the gesture of his arm and the movements within the dripped paint.

To appreciate these pieces, you must really see them in person.  Study them from a distance, and then slowly get closer to examine the details.  I'm going to try to fake this experience now by zooming into this canvas over the next four slides.  Notice again the all over composition, as we zoom in and crop the canvas, the composition itself isn't affected, but smaller and smaller details emerge from the painted surface.

Dekooning came to New York from the Netherlands, he was trained in traditional art techniques and shared many of them with the other Abstract Expressionists. Even though he was one of the Abstract Expressionst much of his work remains directly or indirectly figurative.

In this piece titled "Pink Angels" we again see biomorphic shapes similar to Gorky's. The title gives us a hint as we look at this piece we can make out what seem to be figures painted in pink on the yellow background.

This piece titled "Excavation" is a very powerful work that DeKooning painted in 1950, the same year as Pollock's major solo exhibition and it bears many similarities. The all-over composition is similar to Pollock's as are the colors, neutral canvas background with many crossed black gestural strokes. Look into the patterns in this piece and you will see figurative elements such as eyes and mouths, teeth and lips.

DeKooning is perhaps most famous for his woman series which have been both loved and hated. Garish, vulgar depictions of women with frightening faces and very aggressive brushstrokes. DeKooning worked on these canvases over and over again for many years before he decided they were finished. Examine the brushstrokes layered upon each other, worked and reworked. Now compare the background in this painting...

...to this composition without a figure. Notice the similarity in style, the black smeared through the bright colors muddying them. The aggressive strokes that have been worked and reworked multiple times.

Here is an example of a late painting by DeKooning from the 1980s. His last works return to a soothing and lyrical line with little trace of the aggressive brushstrokes that we see forming in the woman series.

# Color Field

Sometimes the term "action painting" is used to describe artists such as Pollock and de Kooning in contrast to artists making more quiet contemplative artworks. Many of these quieter works fall into the category of color field paintings such as those made by Mark Rothko.

Here we see a painting which, like Pollock's and DeKooning's, could be described as an "all over painting" in that there is no area of the canvas that is less important than any other. However instead of containing the expressive lines and brushstrokes of the action painters these paintings create a mood by using large fields of washed color.

These paintings often create a quiet and introspective feeling, as even the edges between color fields in a Rothko are softened and blurry. The mood of these paintings evoke often has a very direct relationship to the colors used. Just compare the bright and energetic feeling elicited by this yellow and orange painting...

...To the calmer and more subdued feeling found in this darker pink and blue and purple one.

Rothko's paintings often create a feeling of environment that surrounds the viewer to experience these paintings you must be in front of them to encounter just how large they are. Often a series of paintings were made that function together. They would be hung altogether in a room view was also often talk about the spiritual experience of encountering a Rothko.

Ad Reinhardt was also interested in creating paintings that required a calm set of eyes to view.

He coined the term "zero point" to describe paintings that required the eyes to adjust in order to see the image. If you stare closely at one of Reinhardt's black paintings, you begin to see a cross shape filling the center of the canvas. Reinhardt prided himself in making paintings that were almost impossible to photograph, the image in front of you doesn't even come close to the real thing.  The blacks that he lays next to each other are so close in color that one must concentrate on them for a long time before any image is even visible.

Younger artists who join the abstract Expressionism movement were often referred to as the second-generation abstract expressionists.

Helen Frankenthaler was one of these. Her technique of pouring paint directly onto a canvas inspired many other Abex painters. Here we can see how the paint once poured directly onto the canvas has been move moved around and manipulated with brushes. This could also be refered to as a color field painting, but compared to a Rothcko or Reinhardt, the shapes are more flowing and organic.

Frankenthaler achieved an almost watercolor affects by thinning her paints down and applying them in several overlapping washes of color.

Maurice Lewis was influenced greatly by Frankenthaler's techniques.

His veil paintings, so called because they look like tranparent veils, achieve a similar transparency through thin washes of paint which were poured down the surface of the canvas. In this vale painting we can see the direction of the paint pours moves from the bottom of the canvas towards the top and has been divided into several sections.

In this one we see the poured paint starting from the top and spilling down towards the bottom and the sides.
