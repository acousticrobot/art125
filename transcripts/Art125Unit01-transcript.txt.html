<h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>
<p>Before we begin with contemporary art, let's take a step back and look at some of the art that was made during the other 35,000 years of Art History. I'm not going to mention too many names because I don't want you to worry about remembering any artists this week, just the ideas behind the art.</p>
<p>Next week we start our class learning about Abstract Expressionism and Color Field Painting, so I want to start by examining the words: &quot;Abstract&quot;, &quot;Expressionism&quot;, and &quot;Color Field&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's start with the word &quot;abstract&quot;.</p>
<p>We will soon see there are many different types of abstraction out there, and while I don't want to just read off the definition of abstraction to you, I do want to take some time to examine three terms that are often used to describe abstraction: figurative abstraction, representational abstraction, and nonrepresentational abstraction.</p>
<p>If we diagram these out we could say that representational and nonrepresentational abstraction are two separate spheres. And figurative abstraction is one type of representational abstraction.</p>
<p>Figurative abstraction very simply put means abstraction that still references the idea of the figure, so most obviously figures like this one...</p>
<p>...or portraits like this one, would be considered figurative abstraction.</p>
<p>Now a piece like this one, is not really concerned with figures so much as a landscape. This piece is still a representational piece so it would be considered representational abstraction, but not necessarily figurative abstraction.</p>
<p>On the other hand we can have pieces like this...</p>
<p>...or this that aren't representing anything in the natural world. This is what we consider non-representational abstraction because it's interested less in describing a person or a tree, say, and more interested in exploring abstract ideas like color theory and composition.</p>
<p>Joseph Albers was one artist who was interested in focusing on how one color relates to another color, so many of his paintings are made of concentric square fields of color. Not only is nothing represented in this piece, but the only lines in the painting are those created when one field lays next to another.</p>
<p>And here we get one of our definitions for next week for free, because this is exactly what the term &quot;Color Field&quot; is referring to.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-abstraction">How much Abstraction?</h2>
<p>So, now that we have a little understanding of Abstraction, can we start to quantify it, can we ask how abstract is a piece of artwork, or how much art in the History of Art is abstract?</p>
<p>Even if you're not completely confident about what abstraction is, I'm guessing you would still tell me the painting on the left is realistic, and the one on the right is abstract.</p>
<p>And same with these two sculptures, I'm pretty sure everyone would agree that the one on the left is realistic and the one on the right is abstract.</p>
<p>So, since not all artwork fits neatly into pure Abstraction and pure Realism, and it might be easier to imagine a spectrum between these two.</p>
<p>And you could probably decide on a specific place on this spectrum for every piece of art.</p>
<p>And even argue that of any two pieces one is more or less abstract than another.</p>
<p>We can also take two artworks from very different time periods and say they have perhaps the same or similar level of abstraction. Compare Picasso's Guernica with the cave paintings from Lascaux and notice the similar abstract composition of bulls and the horses, even though there is over 17,000 years of history between them.</p>
<p>If we stretch the history of art out in a timeline we see around 4 1/2 thousand years ago the Egyptians started creating very realistic portraits of men and women, and this trend continued on through the Renaissance to ever more realistic depictions of humanity.</p>
<p>If we tried to draw a line, and call certain time periods a &quot;Time of Abstraction&quot; and other time periods &quot;A Time of Realism&quot;...</p>
<p>...one surprising thing is that we find the &quot;Time of Realism&quot; is actually a very short amount of time in the history of art, only about 13% of recorded Art History.</p>
<p>So when we look at abstract art, maybe we're not looking so much at some strange modern break from the past, but rather a return to the normal state of art.</p>
<p>Venus of Hohle Fels, 35-40 thousand years old, Mamoth Ivory, Germany Venus of Willendorf, 24-26 thousand years old, limestone Lascaux Caves, 16 thousand years old, France King Mycerinus and Wife, 4,500 years old, Egypt Discobolus, 2,500 years old, Greece Leonardo Da Vinci, Madonna and Child with a Pomegranate, 1469, Italy Michelangelo, David, 1501-1504, Italy Picasso, Vollard, 1910, France Picasso, Guernica, 1937, Spain Piet Mondrian, Broadway Boogie Woogie, 1940 Jackson Pollock, Lavender Mist, 1950, New York Louise Nevelson, Untitled, 1950, painted wood, New York</p>
<h2 id="return-to-abstraction">Return to Abstraction</h2>
<p>So, we just saw how as long as humans have been making art, very little of the time was spent on Realism. Another surprising thing is there is a little sliver of abstraction at the end of the timeline, when artists return to abstraction with a vengance. So why in the last hundred and fifty or so years do we have this return to abstraction?</p>
<p>Now I don't want to say there's just one answer to this question, but a big part of the answer at least can be traced to an artistic crisis that happens between 19th and 20th centuries. Do you have an idea what could have brought about this crisis?</p>
<p>At this time we find the very first photographs, and while they were at first too blurry or took too long to develop, very quickly photographs became cheaper, faster, and more realistic than paintings.</p>
<p>As soon as photography was able to capture the likeness of human beings, artists were thrown into a crisis because they had to prove to the world that they still had a unique and necessary talent.</p>
<p>And the one thing that painting still had going for it was color. So this is one reason why artists stopped paying attention to making extremely realistic paintings and instead started to focus on style and color.</p>
<p>paintings: Poussin, The Dance to The Music of Time, 1640, French Tiepolo, Apotheosis of Spain, 1762-66, Italian (work is in Spain) Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814, French Millet, The Sower, 1850, Manet, Berthe Morisot, 1872 Cezanne, The Bather, 1885 Monet, Haystacks, 1891, French</p>

<h2 id="expressionism">Expressionism</h2>
<p>The last word we need to define is expressionism.</p>
<p>If we look through the history of art we find that for every piece of artwork that shows humanity and its perfection we can also find an art work that shows the pain and suffering of life.</p>
<p>Why when they could draw or paint or sculpt an image of a perfect human being would artists want to paint the painful or disgusting aspects of humanity?</p>
<p>Take the Isenheim Altarpiece for example, Why would the German artist Matthias Grünewald want to paint such a horrifying picture?</p>
<p>It turns out that this altarpiece was made for a monastery where monks treated people suffering from the plague and other horribly disfiguring diseases. And you can imagine if you were in that state of illness a picture of the perfect human being is not going to give you that much comfort. However if you are looking for some meaning to your suffering and you see an image depicting God in the flesh suffering as much as you are, you are going to be able to relate to that picture.</p>
<p>So The role of art is not only to show us the most beautiful things in the world but also to try and explain the entire human experience. And a lot of what we experience as humans is suffering. This expression of suffering in art is what eventually became associated with an art known as expressionism. And it is from this artwork that Abstract Expressionism gets the second half of its name.</p>
<p>We've already divided the artworks we've looked at into Realism and Abstraction, but another division we could make would be Formalism and Expressionism. Formalism is a term used to describe art that is concerned primarily with breaking things down into visual formal elements. Expressionism on the other hand is interested in trying to describe the emotional content of life.</p>
