## Introduction to Postmodernism: Appropriation

This week we are going to look into what we mean when we use the term 'Postmodernism'. It's a term you hear a lot when talking about contemporary art, but it can mean a lot of different things so the definition is hard to pin down. I want to cover a couple concepts that often are used when describing some of the concerns of Postmodernism: let's start with Appropriation.

Appropriation is the act of taking something that already exists out in the world and reusing it in a way that creates new meaning.  It covers everything from the image of a coke bottle as we saw with Andy Warhol to the sampling that is so common in music today.

Jeff Koons, who continues the trend of pop art, appropriates pop culture and brings it into the art world, such as he did with this life size porcelain sculpture of Michael Jackson.

Sometimes appropriation is more critical in it's message, but still draws from the culture at large.  In this way appropriation can becomes satire, such as this piece we saw by Robert Colescott.

Colescott appropriated the composition of this painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze from 1851. Colescott draws from the patriotic fervor found in this image to contrast it with the African American experience.

Artist like Betye Sarr appropriate actual objects and combine them into new artworks, as we see here in this collage that is made by assembling found objects into a sculpture that challenges racial stereotypes. 

We saw this in the early work of Fred Wilson as well, where the meaning is created though the reorganization of appropriated material from museum collections.

Some artists such as Tom Sachs show both a fascination with as well as a critique of popular culture, as we see in this chain saw he made out of a Chanel shopping bag. He has combined well known brand names with menacing images that include guillotines, death camps, nuclear threats and toilets. We'll see him later in the course.

Photographer Vic Muniz displays a similar love appropriated imagery refashioned in unusual material.  Here he has reproduced the famous image of Che Guevara out of baked beans and photographed the result.

In the second half of this semester, we will see many instances of appropriation used to blur the line between artistic styles.  This impressive wall piece by Arturo Herrera might at first look like a non-representational Abstract Expressionist painting...

... On closer inspection, however, we notice that all the lines are all appropriated from Disney. Cartoon dwarves, ropes, water and trees are collaged together in a way that both obscures and enhances the original images.

## Introduction to Postmodernism: Self Referentiality


Self Referentiality is a little harder to describe so let's break the work apart to see what were dealing with. What we have is two suffixes added to the term "self-reference"

Now self-reference is simply referring to oneself.  Every time you say "I" or "me" you are making a self-reference.

We've already seen work that makes a self-reference, Robert Morris' Box for Standing is a self-reference. In this case it references the proportions of his own body.  In fact any self portrait is a self-reference.

This piece by Mark Quinn, simply titled 'Self' examines the heart of the self-reference, no pun intended.  He collected his own blood over a number of months, and then froze it in a cast of his own head.  Se here the material itself as well as the image are both self-references, and the fragile nature of a frozen sculpture references the fragility of life itself.

Now "-ial" added to the end of a word creates an adjective meaning "of or related to" so self-referential simply means something is related to self-reference, and "-ity" refers to the state of being,

So self-referentiality means means "of or related to the state of being a self-reference", or more simply put, the "state of being self-referential".  So we've seen how we can be self-referential by making a self portrait, but how can an artwork itself be self referential?

One way is by questioning the nature of art itself.  In 1917, the already famous artist Marcel Duchamp signed a urinal R.Mutt, titled it "Fountain", and submitted the piece to an art show who's rules stated all works would be accepted for exhibition as long as the artist paid the fees.  The curators refused to exhibit the work after deciding it wasn't art, but the piece has lived on through the questions it raised about 'what is art?' 

René Magritte made this piece, titled "The Treason of Images" in 1928.  It is a painting of a pipe, with the word's painted below "ceci n'est pas une pipe", "This is not a pipe." This apparent contradiction points out that a painting of a pipe is only a reference to a pipe, not a pipe itself.  By painting these words in the artwork itself, Magritte has made a painting that is in the state of being self-referential. 

Italo Calvino wrote a novel in 1979 titled "If on a winter’s night a traveler". You can stop the slideshow right here and read the first paragraph of the novel fi you'd like.  It starts of by describing you, the reader as you are reading the novel. In fact the novel mentions itself in the first line: "You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, If on a winter's night a traveler."  We have entered self-referentiality here because the novel is aware that it is a novel, it know's it's own name, it even knows it's being read!

Part of what makes self-referentiality so fascinating to us, is we as humans often debate whether we are the only beings who have a concept of self.  Plenty of studies have been done to examine if other intelligent mammals are self-aware.  Do you remember what it was like when you first started to understand that "you" were somebody, that someday you would die?  Living in self-referentiality is something that we continue to come to terms with throughout our lives.

Confronting ourselves means trying to imagine what it is like to see ourselves from the outside.

Sometimes this inner reflection begins to feel like a hall of mirrors.  We can only imagine what it is like to be another compared to what it is like to be ourself.

The face that you put forward is what makes you you to anyone else. Just as we try to imagine the world outside of ourselves, we are continually trying to communicate what life is like inside our own experience.  This self-referential communication is the glue that holds our social species together, and this is why artists return to it again and again.

## Introduction to Postmodernism: Semiotics

The next term we are going to study comes from the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Sausurre. His particular branch of language study became know as structuralism, from it's interest in studying the relationships between smaller parts within a larger, overarching system or structure.

The particular focus of his that postmodernism is most concerned with is semiotics, or the study of signs.  Sausurre said all language could be broken down into signs, that is chunks of meaning, at that each of these signs contained both a signifier and a signified.

Let's take an example: I'm going to say the word "wine"

In this case the signifier is either the sound of the word wine when you hear the word, or the letters that make up the word.  

And the signified is what you think of when you hear or read the word.  Together they create the meaning that is communicated by the word wine.

Let me elaborate by telling you a joke: What does a grape say when you step on it?

Nothing it just gives out a little whine.

This kind of joke is a pun, and puns intentionally confuse two words which are either spelled or sound the same.  When the wires get crossed between the signifier and the signified, we end up with a faulty sign. Normally this kind of miscommunication is just frustrating, but when it's a joke, and we 'get it' this can be funny.

Here's another joke, hilarious, right?  What, you don't get it?

The reason you don't get it is that it has been translated from Chinese.
米的媽媽是誰？
是花。
啊？
因為，花生米。

The three characters that when put together mean "shelled peanuts" in Chinese, if read as a sentence, could mean something like "flower gives birth to rice", so therefore the joke is that flower is the mother of rice. Sausurre said that the relation between signifier and signified is arbitrary.  We may say "peanut" or "wine" but nothing is signified if you say these things to someone who doesn't speak English.

Now this is why semiotics is particularly interesting to visual artists, because we have an advantage here. When I show you a picture of wine, it doesn't matter what languages you speak, the same meaning will come across. Wherever you are in the world, as long as you know what wine looks like, a picture of wine will still work as a signifier for the concept of wine.

## Introduction to Postmodernism: Semiotics Part II

If we're talking about structuralism, and we're describing post-modernism, then it only makes sense that we talk about post-structuralism, right?  Post-structuralists were a group of French intellectuals in the 1960's and 1970's who grew out of structuralism, and ended up critiquing many of it's ideas. Roland Barthes is one such post-structuralist, and one who took Sausurre's ideas one step further.

Now, remember, semiotics says that all meaning is communicated with signs, which are made of both a signifier and a signified.

Barthes said myth was a "second level signifier" that took it's meaning from language. He use the idea of Myth to describe the beliefs we hold as a society.

Let's look at this in terms of the American flag.  Now, when I say "American Flag" that is the signifier, and you picture in your mind the American flag and that's the signified.  Together they are the sign that communicates the idea of the American flag. 

What Barthes is saying is that the idea of the American flag also acts as a signifier, and what is signified is everything that we believe to be true about America today. 

One nation, under God, indivisible and all that stuff, is what he refers to as a Myth, an idea that's larger than life we believe or create or imagine. Sometimes these ideas become so big, that we sometimes take them for granted.  What is this a picture of really, George Washington, or the idea of "America"?

For some, the ideas represented by myths are so important, that to even question them is an act of betrayal.

And that is why they become such tempting images for artists. Faith Ringgold, in "Flag for the Moon" turns the stripes of the flag into a racial slur.  We have three signifier here: The most immediate is what we see first: the American Flag.  The second is the obscured racial slur hidden in the flag the title, which points to the racism and history of slavery that is also part of this nation. Lastly, we have the title. The same year she completed this painting, 1969 was also the year we landed a human on the moon.  By putting these three signifiers together, and what each one signifies, she melds them together into one complete sign, the question that is often asked, "How come we can land a man on the moon, but we cannot end racism and inequality?"

Jasper John's appropriating the American flag is a powerful work for a very different reason.  He asks us to just look at the flag again as if for the first time.  He says he is interested in "What the mind already knows". We know this flag, we see is all the time.

In fact he experiments with removing signifiers, in this version all the color, to show us how we the American flag is still signified. When he presents us with the flag, and doesn't ask that we take any specific meaning away from the work, this is what we refer to as an open-ended signifier.  And it is this openness to seeing, openness to experience that Artists want to create in their viewers.

It's one thing when criticism comes from within, but when we are criticized from the outside it becomes even harder to evaluate messages in terms of the signifier and the signified, to not return to our firmly held beliefs.

Art presents us with powerful messages to force us to reevaluate our opinions, our conclusions, the structures we take for granted or accept complacently.

Artworks present these combinations of signifiers to us in an organized way.  They allow us a chance to practice reading images for the messages they contain.  This in tern helps us to be able to read the images that come from the much more complex and chaotic world at large. If we understand signification at the level of Myth, we can start to understand the world in which we live.  Remove our own culture and language, it is images alone that convey what is signified.
