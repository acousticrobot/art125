### Copy and Paste Question Format

	Replace this sample text with your questions.

	Q: Each question should start with 'Q:' or be successively numbered.
	A. If there are choices, the first choice should start with 'A.'.
	B. Each successive choice should start with the next letter and a period.
	C. Each choice should be on a single line, but it is OK if it is longer than will fit in the text area and it wraps on its own.
	ANSWER: B
	POINTS: 2

Instructions: Replace the sample text in the text box with the questions you want to import. You can also set the default choice question format, open-ended question format and point value for questions. The questions text should conform to the following specifications.

  * Each question should begin on a new line.
  * The first line of each question should start with 'Q:' or the question number followed by a period ('1.', 2.', '3.', etc.).
  * If the question has choices the choices should immediately follow the question text.
  * Each choice should be on a line by itself.
  * Each choice should begin with a choice letter followed by a period ('A.', 'B.', 'C.', etc.). 

The following optional settings may be added after the question and its choices. Each setting should be on a line by itself and follow the format SettingName: SettingValue.
