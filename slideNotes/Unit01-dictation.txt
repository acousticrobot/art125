## Abstraction

Before we begin with contemporary art, let's take a step back and look at some of the art that was made during the other 35,000 years of Art History.  I'm not going to mention too many names because I don't want you to worry about remembering any artists this week, just the ideas behind the art.

Next week we start our class learning about Abstract Expressionism and Color Field Painting, so I want to start by examining the words: "Abstract", "Expressionism", and "Color Field". Let's start with the word "abstract".

Now we will soon see there are many different types of abstraction out there, and while I don't want to just read off the definition of abstraction to you, I do want to take some time to examine three terms that are often used to describe abstraction: figurative abstraction, representational abstraction, and nonrepresentational abstraction. If we were going to diagram these out we could say that representational and nonrepresentational abstraction are two separate spheres. And figurative abstraction is one type of representational abstraction.

Figurative abstraction very simply put means abstraction that still references the idea of the figure, so most obviously portraits like this one, 

or this piece which references both a horse and a steam engine are both examples of figurative abstraction.

Now a piece like this one, although there are small figures in it, is not really concerned with figures so much as a landscape. So this piece is still a representational piece so it would be considered representational abstraction, but not necessarily figurative abstraction. 

On the other hand we can have pieces like this, 

or this that aren't representing anything in the natural world. This is what we consider non-representational abstraction because it's not trying to represent anything except for pure visual phenomena. 

Joseph Albers is one artist who was interested in just examining through painting how one color relates to another color.  Fields of color laying next to each other, where the only lines are those created in-between the fields. Here we get our definition for next week for free, because this is exactly what the term "Color Field" is referring to.

## How much Abstraction?

Looking at these two paintings, even if you're not completely confident about what abstraction is, I'm guessing you can still tell me which one is abstract. And same with these two sculptures, I'm pretty sure everyone would agree that the one on the left is realistic and the one on the left is abstract.

Now you've probably noticed that not all artwork fits neatly into pure Abstraction and pure realism, and I'm going to say you could probably even draw a spectrum between these two.

So if we've got a spectrum, I'm going to say you could probably decide on a specific place for every piece of art on this spectrum.

And even argue that of any two piece one is more or less abstract than another.

We can also take two artworks from very different time periods and say they have perhaps the same or similar level of abstraction. Compare Picasso's Guernica with the cave paintings from Lascaux and notice the similar abstract composition of bulls and the horses, even though there is over 17,000 years of history between them.

If we stretch the history of art out in a timeline we can maybe begin to start calling certain time periods a "Time of Abstraction" and other time periods "A Time of Realism". Around 4 1/2 thousand years ago the Egyptians started creating very realistic portraits of men and women and this continued on through the Renaissance to ever more realistic depictions of humanity.

One surprising thing is that we find the "Time of Realism" is actually a very short amount of time in the history of art, only about 13% of recorded Art History.  

## Return to Abstraction

So, we just saw how as long as humans have been making art, very little of the time was spent on Realism.  Another surprising thing is there is a little sliver of abstraction at the end of the timeline, when artists return to abstraction with a vengance. So why in the last hundred and fifty or so years do we have this return to abstraction?

Now I don't want to say there's just one answer to this question, but a big part of the answer at least can be traced to an artistic crisis that happens between 19th and 20th centuries. Do you have an idea what could have brought about this crisis?

At this time we find the very first photographs, and while they were at first too blurry or took too long to develop, very quickly photographs became cheaper, faster, and more realistic than paintings.

As soon as photography was able to capture the likeness of human beings better and faster, artists were thrown into a crisis because they have to prove to the world that they still had a unique and necessary talent. Now that photography was around the one thing that painting still had going for it was color.  So this is one reason why artists stopped paying attention to making extremely realistic paintings and instead started to focus on style and color.

## Expressionism

The next word we want to define is expressionism. If we look through the history of art we find that for every piece of artwork that shows humanity and its perfection we can also find an art work that shows the pain and suffering of life. 

Why when you can draw or paint or sculpt an image of a perfect human being would artists want to paint the painful or disgusting aspects of humanity?  Take the Isenheim Altarpiece for example, Why would the German artist Matthias Gr√ºnewald want to paint such a horrifying picture?

It turns out that this altarpiece was made for a monastery where monks treated people suffering from the plague and other horribly disfiguring diseases. And you can imagine if you were in that state of illness a picture of the perfect human being is not going to give you that much comfort. However if you are looking for some meaning to your suffering and you see an image depicting God in the flesh suffering as much as you are, you are going to be able to relate to that picture.

So The role of art is not only to show us the most beautiful things in the world but also to try and explain the entire human experience. And a lot of what we experience as humans is suffering. This expression of suffering in art is what eventually became associated with an art known as expressionism. And it is from this artwork that Abstract Expressionism gets the second half of its name. 

We've already divided the artworks we've looked at into Realism and Abstraction, but another division we could make would be Formalism and Expressionism.  Formalism is a term used to describe art that is concerned primarily with breaking things down into visual formal elements. Expressionism on the other hand is interested in trying to describe the emotional content of life.
