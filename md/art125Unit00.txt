### Introduction (ULO 3-4)

Hello and welcome to Art125 Topics in Contemporary Art.  My name is Jonathan Gabel, and I will be your professor for this class.  I have been teaching versions of this class since 1995, but this is the first time I am presenting in on line, so please make sure everything makes sense, and feel free to reach out with any suggestions or questions as the class goes along.  Along with the course material you will find here, I will be maintaining pages on my own website where we can continue the dialogue throughout the class. This is also a good place to post general questions for each unit. These pages will always be grouped together at [jonathangabel.com/learn/art125](http://jonathangabel.com/learn/art125) so go ahead and bookmark it now. 

This first week of classes, we will be going through unit 1, and introductory unit that gets us all up to speed before jumping into the New York art scene in the 1940s.  Most of the units will present one week's worth of material, and will be structured similarly to unit one.  Here are the sections you can expect to see:

#### Unit Learning Objectives

This is a very general list of key concepts presented in the unit.  It is used by the school to align what we cover in the unit to the material presented.  You can use this to orient yourself at the beginning, or review it at the end to make sure you feel clear on the items listed.

#### Introduction

Every class will start out with a short written piece where I lay out for you what the class covers.  Sometimes it is a preview of the material, but I also will use it add material or to clarify things that may not be clearly stated in the readings or slideshows. You should make sure to read it beforehand so you know what to look for in the material, and what may be presented in the testing sections.

#### Textbook readings and Review Questions

For this first week, there are no readings from the book, but you are required to buy [Twentieth-Century American Art by Erika Doss](http://www.amazon.com/Twentieth-Century-American-Oxford-History-ebook/dp/B001KU81IM/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1).  Make sure you buy it in time to do next weeks reading assignment. After the reading, there will be a section of multiple choice or short answer questions. You can take these tests as often as you want, they are there to help you see if you understood the material.  It is also a good idea to make sure you understand the correct answers, as the midterm and final exams will draw from these questions.

#### Slideshows and videos

Each week, there will be a series of either slideshows or videos.  If there is something I really want to explain to you, I will put together a series of short slideshows which you can watch on line.  Other times, when there are good videos available on line where artists are explaining their own work, I will link to them instead.

#### Readings

There will almost always be an additional reading section, where I pick out some reading that related to the week's material.  Often I will heavily edit these down so that you can get a sense of what the reading is about without having to go through pages and pages of material.

#### Unit Assessment

This section will be a combination of multiple choice exercises drawing from the readings, videos and slideshows.  Sometimes you will be identifying artwork, sometimes identifying names of artists, and sometimes answering questions about ideas or concepts presented.  Just like with the test questions after the readings from the book, practice these questions until you get them right.  Don't be discouraged if you get some wrong the first time.  You can take these tests as often as you like.  And use them to study for the midterm and final.

#### Discussion Board Question

This is our change to interact with each other and develop some of the presented ideas further.  You will be given an essay question, which I will ask you to answer in a couple sentences. IMPORTANT: This part will have two due dates.  First, you will have to answer the question before 11:55 on Wednesday.  Then you will be required to respond to at least two of your classmates before 11:55 on Sunday night.  Obviously this is a little artificial of a way to create a dialogue, but the hope is we can use this as a way to creating some interesting conversations around the material.  The sooner in the week you post, and the more posts you make, the better we will get to know each other.


#### Optional links for further self-study

I don't want to overwhelm you with work each week, but I also want to give you places to go to look for more material if you are interested.  This section will be totally optional for you to explore.

#### Comments on my website

Once again, any questions that you have, probably someone else has them too, so don't be shy, ask away.  Each unit will have a page on my website where you can post comments or questions, and I should be able to reply pretty quickly.  Come see this [welcome page](http://jonathangabel.com/learn/art125/welcome) and introduce yourself in the comments. Then lets get started on unit 1!
