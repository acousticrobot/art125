The beginning of Pop Art as an artistic movement is often pegged to the British artist **Richard Hamilton**’s 1956 collage *Just What Is It that Makes Today’s Home’s So Different, So Appealing?* and that's where we start our class today. We also look at our local fathers of Pop, **Jasper Johns** and **Robert Rauschenberg**. Both of these artists, whose careers began in New York in the 1950s, show us a style of work that breaks with many of the basic premises of Abstract Expressionism. Yet they also exhibit a quality of painterly expression, which shows they were paying attention to lessons learned in recent abstract painting. 


So, what was it that makes these artists so different, so appealing? With a little background into the **Black Mountain College**, **happenings**, and the work of **John Cage**, a musician and composer who used chance to structure musical compositions.  His piece *4'33"* is a performance where a pianist sits at a piano for four minutes and forty three seconds without playing anything.  The background noise in the auditorium during that time is what he considers the music of the piece.  By examining such works, pop artists began to bring ideas such as **chance** and **performance** into the visual arts.

Now that you know a little about **Greenberg** and his drive to push every artistic medium back to is own roots, you can imagine that performance opened up possibilities for artists such as Rauschenberg and Johns. Possibilities which fit outside of the formalist, non-representational work that was receiving most of the attention. Contrary to Greenberg’s wish for each medium to be isolated, we see pieces with representation and narrative, paintings which are also sculptures, sculptures which also serve as backdrops for performance.

Often a distinction arises between the critical nature of British pop art, and the American Pop Art's unapologetic embrace of consumer culture. But let’s not be too broad in this generalization, as the underlying unease we see in the Abstract Expressionists also shows up in pieces like the giant *F-111* by **James Rosenquist**, which features a young child blissfully having her hair done at a beauty salon, while a nuclear mushroom cloud erupts in the background. Or **Andy Warhol**’s pieces from the Birmingham Race riots and the car accidents from his disaster series.

In this class we back up to the beginning of the course, and start again in Europe. After the Second World War, our attention turned to the American Art scene, but the artistic traditions of Europe continued to evolve as well. Sometimes this paralleled the work we’ve seen so far, and sometimes it followed it’s own trajectory.<!--more--> This class is only a quick survey of European art from the 1950s to the present, but we also manage to cover quite a few movements that spring up during this time.

In the 1960s, the Italian art scene becomes well known through the work of the Arte Povera movement. Using poor materials, that is materials of everyday occurrence, they commented on issues of contemporary society, as well as the historical traditions of Italian art.

In Austria, a group of artists centered around Herman Nitsch became known as the Viennese Actionists. Documenting performances through photography, they explored the Dionysian and visceral side of ritual. These pieces can be seen as carnal performances exploring the darker side of life.

In Germany, post-war reparations took a more apologetic tone, and artists such as Joseph Beuys looked to performance as a way to find healing rather than carnage. Other artists began exploring what became known as Neo-Expressionism, direct unmitigated expression with the traditional medium of paint and canvass. We will follow this style into the American scene in the 1980s as well.

In England in the 1990s, we also see a group of artists become collectively known as the YBA, or Young British Artists. Often creating sensational work, they don’t so much share a common style or subject, as much as a common interest in producing provocative artworks.

### After this class you should be able to

#### Define the following:

  * Arte Povera
  * Neo-Expressionism
  * trickster

  * After World War II, how did modernism develop differently in Europe and the United States?

	In the 1990s the contemporary art scene became much less provincial, and started to look beyond American shores for good contemporary art. This not only included Europe, but the entire rest of the world. We don’t have time to go back and see what was going on everywhere for the last sixty years, but we can do a survey of contemporary artists from the other continents.<!--more-->
