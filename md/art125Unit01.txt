## Unit Student Assessments & Activities

### Introduction (ULO 3-4)

![Venus of Willendorf, 20,000 bce][preHistory001]

Our course starts in New York in the 1940s, but 35,000 years of recorded art history exist before this point. Before we touch down with both feet running, what should we be aware of, what lessons from the past can we take with us?

In this introductory class, we first look at a very few select pieces of work, from as old as the Venus figurine from Hohle Fels, made of Mammoth Ivory, up to a couple American works from 1950. Stretching them into a timeline, we discuss the spectrum from realism to abstraction, and discover realism encompasses a relatively small part of the history of art.

We examine what factors cause artists to return to abstraction in the 1800s, and how this trend continues up to the Abstract Expressionists. We also look at the differences between Formalism and Expressionism, asking what reasons artists would have to paint ugly or disturbing images. Next week, we will pick after the world wars, and see what happened when New York became the center of the art world.

#### Discussion Board Question

Now that you have become familiar with the artists and concepts presented in this unit, it is time to start making connections.  Here is your chance to apply what you learned in the readings to some of the artwork you have seen. 

First, you will start a thread by answering the Essay question below. 

Then you will reply to at least two (2) other students posts to get the discussion going.  

Please make sure you meet the due dates for these posts.

##### Essay Question:

Please copy one line from Greenberg's article "Modernist Painting".  Then write a paragraph in which you examine how it applies to the work of one of the artists you learned about in the slide presentations.  Pick one of these artist: Hans Hofmann, Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Willem De Kooning, Marc Rothko, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Clifford Still, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis.

#### Voice Thread Question

Here is another painting by Hans Hoffman.  Describe how he used what he calls the "push and pull" of the composition to create space in the painting.

### essay question

Paradigm Shift  
: 1. fundamental change in the way of doing things, 
: 2. acceptance by a majority of a changed belief, attitude, or way of doing things 

It is said that after World War II, world culture experienced a paradigm shift.  Explain how Sartre’s statement that mankind is “condemned to be free” and his idea of “existential anguish” illustrate this new belief system. Explain how the work of the Abstract Expressionists can be seen as illustrating this paradigm shift.
