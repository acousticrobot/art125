## Unit Student Assessments & Activities

### Introduction (ULO 3-4)

Photography has been with us throughout this course. From the very first lecture we talked about the crisis it created in the plastic arts. When technology came along that could capture a personâ€™s likeness completely, traditional artists had to prove they still had something to contribute to society.

We saw photography again in performance art. Wherever temporary art needed to be preserved, photography was there to provide documentation. In fact, all of the art we have seen to date, we have seen because of photography. With digital photography, we are able to look at artwork in class that just went on exhibit in a gallery in New York or anywhere else in the world.

It is such a common occurrence in our lives that it can almost become transparent. Today, we will focus on photography as a medium, and see how it has not only supported contemporary art, but also shaped it. I have picked ten artists for us to consider, starting with works from the beginning of our course and ending with some contemporary works.

**Gordon Parks** was a photographer who worked for Time magazine, often documenting the lives of the poor and working class, and examining issues of race and inequality.**William Eggleston** is often credited with bringing color photography into the world of fine art, and is well known for the "road trip" theme of photographic documentation, as he would often compose books of images he took while traveling around the United States. **Bernd and Hilla Becher** are best known for creating grids of similar industrial structures (steel towers, gas tanks, etc.) They carefully document the structures in the same lighting conditions to emphasize the similarity and differences.  **Edward Burtynsky** examines large-scale industrial landscapes with an eye for both the sublime beauty and ecological devastation. **Thomas Demand** carefully constructs life size paper sculptures of interiors and machines, photographs them, and presents the photographs as the final piece. **Philip Lorca Dicorcia** investigates the 'non event', that is, sometimes carefully posed, sometimes spoontaneous instances where the subject is witdrawn and unaware of the photographic moment.  He uses flashes and lighting that often isolates the subject from the background, heightening the drama within the photo. **Cindy Sherman** uses elaborate makup to create self portraits where she presents herself as a *type*-- either a stereotype or an even an absurdity. **Niki S. Lee** does something similar, but inserts herself into subcultures in these disguises, questioning the nature of racial and social identity. **Erwin Wurm** creates a hybrid of humor, sculpture, and performance in his *one minute sculptures* and presents them as photographs. **Roni Horn** examines the nature of time and identity through intimate portraits of family and friends.
