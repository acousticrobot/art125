Photography has been with us throughout this course. From the very first lecture we talked about the crisis it created in the plastic arts. When technology came along that could capture a personâ€™s likeness completely, traditional artists had to prove they still had something to contribute to society.<!--more-->

We saw photography again in performance art. Wherever temporary art needed to be preserved, photography was there to provide documentation. In fact, all of the art we have seen to date, we have seen because of photography. With digital photography, we are able to look at artwork in class that just went on exhibit in a gallery in New York or anywhere else in the world. .

It is such a common occurrence in our lives that it can almost become transparent. Today, we will focus on photography as a medium, and see how it has not only supported contemporary art, but also shaped it.
